# Movies
iOS test for Nodes Agency.

A fictive client called Yoyo Cinema has tasked Nodes to build an app where their customers are able to search for films, see details, favourite etc.

1) Film search (Use this API endpoint https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=4cb1eeab94f45affe2536f2c684a5c9e&query=<search_query> (GET)), display the films in what ever UI you want.
2) The user should be able to see details of the film (Use this API endpoint https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/<id>?api_key=4cb1eeab94f45affe2536f2c684a5c9e (GET))
3) The user should be able to favourite and unfavorite a movie (Use whatever local storage that you think make sense)
4) The user should be able to see a list of favourite movies (and from there go to the detail movie screen)
